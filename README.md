## Accumulation Distribution Line

The Accumulation Distribution Line (ADL) is a momentum indicator that relates price and volume. It combines price and volume to show how much money is flowing in or out of a security. It is calculated by adding the money flow volume to the previous ADL.

```math
ADL = \text{Previous ADL} + \text{Current Money Flow Volume}
```

## Average Directional Index (ADX)

The Average Directional Index (ADX) measures the strength of a trend without regard to its direction. It is part of the Directional Movement System developed by J. Welles Wilder.

```math
\text{ADX} = \text{SMA}(\frac{\text{TR}_n}{\text{DMI}}, n)
```

## Aroon

Aroon is an indicator system that determines whether a stock is trending or not and how strong the trend is. It consists of two lines: Aroon Up and Aroon Down. Aroon Up measures the number of periods since the highest high, while Aroon Down measures the number of periods since the lowest low.

```math
\text{Aroon Up} = \left( \frac{\text{Period} - \text{Number of Periods Since Highest High}}{\text{Period}} \right) \times 100
```

```math
\text{Aroon Down} = \left( \frac{\text{Period} - \text{Number of Periods Since Lowest Low}}{\text{Period}} \right) \times 100
```

## Average True Range (ATR)

The Average True Range (ATR) measures market volatility by calculating the average range between successive periods. It considers any gaps in trading that may occur between periods.

```math
ATR = \text{SMA}(\left| \text{High} - \text{Low} \right|, n)
```

## Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band (SMA) and two outer bands that are standard deviations away from the middle band. They provide a relative definition of high and low prices. The upper band indicates overbought conditions, while the lower band indicates oversold conditions.

```math
\text{Upper Band} = \text{SMA}(Close, n) + (k \times \text{StdDev}(Close, n))
```

```math
\text{Lower Band} = \text{SMA}(Close, n) - (k \times \text{StdDev}(Close, n))
```

## Bollinger Bands %B

%B measures a security's position relative to the bands. It quantifies a security's price relative to the upper and lower bands.
```math
\%B = \frac{(Close - \text{Lower Band})}{(\text{Upper Band} - \text{Lower Band})}
```

## Bollinger Bands Width

The Bollinger Bands Width quantifies the width of the Bollinger Bands. It is calculated as the percentage difference between the upper and lower bands relative to the middle band.

```math
BBW = \frac{(\text{Upper Band} - \text{Lower Band})}{\text{SMA}(Close, n)}
```

```

```math
-DI = 100 \times \frac{(Smoothed -DM)}{ATR}
```

## Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to price changes compared to the SMA. It is calculated using a smoothing factor (Î±).

```math
EMA = \alpha \times Close + (1 - \alpha) \times \text{Previous EMA}
```

## Fibonacci Retracement

Fibonacci Retracement is a tool used in technical analysis to identify potential support and resistance levels based on the Fibonacci sequence.

```math
\text{Fibonacci Retracement Levels} = \text{High} - (\text{High} - \text{Low}) \times \{0, 0.236, 0.382, 0.5, 0.618, 1\}

\text{Middle Line} = \text{EMA}(Close, n)
```

```math
\text{Upper Channel} = \text{Middle Line} + (ATR \times \text{ATRMultiplier})
```

```math
\text{Lower Channel} = \text{Middle Line} - (ATR \times \text{ATRMultiplier})
```

```math
OBV = \text{Previous OBV} + \text{Volume if Close} > \text{Previous Close}
```

```math
OBV = \text{Previous OBV} - \text{Volume if Close} < \text{Previous Close}
```

```math
OBV = \text{Previous OBV} \text{ if Close} = \text{Previous Close}
```

## Parabolic SAR (PSAR)

The Parabolic SAR (PSAR) is a trend-following indicator that helps traders identify potential reversal points in price direction. It is plotted on the price chart and moves incrementally closer to the price as the trend extends.

```math
PSAR = \text{Previous PSAR} + AF \times (EP - \text{Previous PSAR})
```

## Pivot Points

Pivot Points are used to determine potential support and resistance levels based on the previous day's trading range.

```math
\text{Pivot Point} = \frac{\text{High} + \text{Low} + \text{Close}}{3}
```

```math
\text{Support and Resistance Levels} = \{ \text{R1, R2, R3, S1, S2, S3} \}
```
